        <p class="intro-issues-para container">
          One of the biggest reasons I’m running for The Advisory Neighborhood Commission (6C04) is that I want to be a voice for my constituents and raise the issues that they care about - something that I think is unfortunately often lost in government. So with that in mind, before talking about some issues that I personally care about, I want to hear from you about the issues that YOU care about. While I wish I could have met and heard from all of my neighbors prior to launching my campaign, I know that was not feasible. So in the meantime, as I develop plans to meet more people, while still following the guidance from public health experts, I would love to hear from you online. Is there an issue that you care about? Please let me know <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjFWdSYDfSHP33uEr9BcvHofh6z2-zwrzBth1pkFvgCHFxLQ/viewform"> here</a>!

        <h2>Working for our Neighbors</h2>
        <p>
          The Advisory Neighborhood Council was established to help provide DC residents with the ability to have a greater say in matters that impact them, their families, and their neighborhoods. And that is exactly what it should be for. Unfortunately, I know many people do not feel that they have a say in what goes on either locally or across the city. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If I am elected as your ANC commissioner the number one priority for me will be to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to have their voices heard. This starts with introducing reforms to the ANC commission so that they provide more opportunities for neighbors to have a voice at meetings. One of the things I was struck by when I attended my first ANC 6C meeting was that there was no “public comment” section on the agenda and no formal way for public attendees to voice their concerns or opinions at meetings. If I am elected to the ANC, I would work with my fellow commissioners to ensure that our neighbors will always have an opportunity to bring up items at the meetings. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Another priority area would be ensuring that the ANC is a hub of information for our neighbors. I believe that the ANC Commission should not only serve the role of disseminating information from the DC government but also share information shared by the community, for the community. If elected,  I would work with to develop a monthly-newsletter that our neighbors can not only subscribe to but also submit information too. I would also work to make sure that information is more accessible on the ANC website and other platforms such as Twitter or Facebook for more readily available access. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I want to make sure that our resources are being used to support the greater community. It was pretty stunning to see that despite the increased need of the community during COVID-19, the ANC was not using its resources or platform to support the community through direct action. I would work to make sure that the resources provided to the ANC commission were being used in ways that would benefit the community. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The bottom line is that as an ANC commissioner I would work to ensure that my neighbors are being heard, that the ANC is a resource, and that I use my platform as a commissioner to work with the community, to benefit the community.

      <div class="public-saftey container">
        <h2>Public Safety</h2>
        <p>
          Public Safety is one of the most critical issues in DC. Everyone deserves to feel safe in their neighborhood and community. And while ANC 6C is fortunate to not experience as high of a rate of violence and crime as some other parts of the city, it is still a major concern for many of our community members. I have seen countless neighbors post on Nextdoor, building groups, and other public forums describing their concerns around public safety, violence, and crime. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While this issue must be addressed, I want to be clear that this must be done through <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Aiz2c2RtON_9U8pxYd6yIKp-vz0EE7fy/view?usp=sharing">community-based solutions</a>, by investing in programs that address root cause issues, and programs that do not further endanger members of our community, specifically the black and brown community and our youth. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an issue that I have cared deeply about since moving to DC. As an active member of the DC Chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America I have been a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r2BlEHS5w5jlZaXuaJZEsb-Y1GTgOeBX/view?usp=sharing"> strong advocate</a> for the development and expansion of the DC Safe Passage Program, a program that helps keep students safe on their commute to and from school, continued to advocate for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/local-opinions/the-coronavirus-is-no-excuse-to-ignore-gun-violence-in-dc/2020/05/21/b4690c84-99d5-11ea-ac72-3841fcc9b35f_story.html"> sustained funding </a>for community-based violence interruption and prevention programs,  engaged with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dcecc2015/videos/647068872539263/"> key stakeholders </a> across the city, including members of the DC Council to develop comprehensive and evidence-based strategies to keep our communities safe. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If I am elected as ANC Commissioner I would make ensuring public safety a high priority for the commission. I will work with my fellow commissioners and a wide variety of stakeholders to have a real discussion around these issues and take direct steps to make sure that neighbors feel safe in their community.

      <div class="education container">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          As a former teacher, I know first hand about how important the education system is to the community. And ANC 6C is lucky to have some great neighborhood schools. But the reality is that the DC education system has a long way to go to ensure that all students are able to access an excellent education. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our schools not only provide students with an education, but they also provide students with access to healthy meals, support their socio-emotional wellbeing, and connect families with resources that they might need. That is why even before running for ANC, I have been working towards supporting our students, our teachers, and our schools. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In January, I <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Fcl9_eI7QdTXsHz3wWoKF7qOgnsnqTH/view?usp=sharing"> testified </a> at the DC Council at the Performance Oversight Hearing for the Deputy Mayor of Education and spoke about the importance of increasing the at-risk weight in the school funding formula to ensure schools receive adequate resources to serve all our students and about the need for all schools to have dedicated DBH mental health professionals to support our students. When the COVID-19 pandemic started, and students had to make the transition to distance-learning, I drafted a letter to Mayor Bowser and the DC Council, along with a coalition of partners, about the need to ensure <a href="https://www.change.org/p/mayor-muriel-bowser-ensuring-equitable-access-to-distance-learning"> equitable access to distance learning </a>and continued this conversation with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dcecc2015/videos/705694813302343/"> key advocates </a> to bring awareness to this issue. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If elected to the ANC, I will work alongside educators, families, students, LSAT members, and PTO’s to ensure that our schools receive the support that they need to drive student outcomes and achieve educational equity. 
        </p>

      <div class="homeless container">
        <h2>Homeless Encampments</h2>
        <p>
          I am sure that by this point, everyone in DC has heard the message “Stay At Home” in order to keep yourself and your community safe. Unfortunately, this is not possible for so many of our neighbors who are facing homelessness. As everyone knows, this is not a recent issue that was brought about by COVID-19, but instead a systemic issue in Washington DC and within ANC 6C. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier this year, this issue gained a lot of attention as the DC government decided that they would permanently remove the homeless encampments under the <a href="https://dcist.com/story/20/01/07/d-c-will-permanently-remove-homeless-encampments-one-noma-underpass/"> NoMa underpass</a>. This was done with very little input from the community and done without warning or supporting the individuals living there. Unsurprisingly this resulted in a lot of anger and frustration -- and no long term solution.  Unfortunately, this issue continues to persist today, and folks who have returned to living there, not only are dealing with the same issues they were before, now they are doing it while being <a href="https://wamu.org/story/20/05/14/homeless-residents-in-d-c-face-high-rates-of-covid-19-infections-and-deaths-during-quarantine/"> especially vulnerable </a> to COVID-19. This has not only caused them to be at a higher risk of catching the disease themselves but also spreading it to the community. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As your ANC commissioner, I will partner with the ANC and community organizations to ensure that we are properly supporting the individuals living in the homeless encampments, and through support, will be able to create a long-term sustainable solution to this issue.
