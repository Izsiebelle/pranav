                    I grew up in a small town on the seacoast of New Hampshire with my parents and two sisters, as a second-generation Indian-American. I attended the local public school district where I fell in love with history, geography, government, and politics. As an avid, lifelong soccer player I learned a lot about the importance of teamwork and taking piano lessons for most of my childhood taught me the importance of hard work and dedication. In high school, I was actively involved in our student government, athletics, community service clubs, and even participated in two musicals. Being so involved pushed me to learn how to balance and manage my time, but also showed me how much I enjoyed getting to know and work with different people and groups - something I still very much enjoy today.

                <p>
                    After graduating from high school I moved to Washington DC to attend George Washington University. When I started at GW, I thought I had my whole life planned out: I would study International Affairs in our nation's capital, go to Law School, and then move back home to New Hampshire. But, while at GW, I fell in love with the city of DC. I had the opportunity to get more involved with the community when I founded the Kusala tutoring-mentoring program in partnership with Maya Angelou Public Charter School. I had the opportunity to participate in city-wide days of service such as Freshman Day of Service, Gandhi Day of Service, and Martin Luther King Jr Day of Service through the GW Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service.

                    I also had the opportunity to learn more about service and education through various GW programs and internship opportunities. I had the incredible chance to visit Nicaragua and Cape Town, South Africa where I got to participate in education-based community development projects. I also got the chance to intern at the White House in the Office of Presidential Correspondence where I got to read thousands of pieces of correspondence written by students to the president. This really opened my eyes to the diverse experiences of students across the country and really cemented my desire to work with and uplift the voices of students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After graduating from GW, despite my love of DC, I moved to Kansas City to pursue an opportunity to continue to work to uplift the voices of students. I joined Teach For America and taught US and World History at an alternative charter high school. Teach For America was no doubt the most challenging experience I have had in my life, but it also was the most rewarding. The relationships that I built with my students, many of which have continued after I left the classroom, is no doubt one of the things I am most proud of. And while leaving the classroom was one of the most difficult decisions that I have had to make, I left knowing I had created lasting relationships and an unrelenting desire to fight for my students and students like them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After leaving the classroom, DC called me home, where I have been working in education policy. Through my work this past year,  I  have had the opportunity to work with state and district superintendents of large school systems across the country. I have had the opportunity to witness and learn from a diverse range of incredible leaders and also have had the chance to learn more about policies and practice which resulted in the best outcomes for students. Upon returning to DC  I also got involved with the DC Chapter of Moms Demand Action, the DC Education Coalition for Change, Serve Your City and the Ward 6 Mutual Aid Network, and many other grassroots community organizations.

                <p>
                    Throughout my life, I have been dedicated to working to improve my local community. Whether it was on the soccer field, in the classroom, in different areas around the world, or in the classroom, I have always worked to make a difference in the lives of the people I interact with. And these values are what will lead me in my work if I am elected to represent you as your ANC commissioner.
